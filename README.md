# Fall-Detection Using Machine Learning

Elderly individuals face a constant risk of falls, impacting their ability to live independently. To address this, it is crucial to develop a precise, reliable, robust, and convenient solution, especially for seniors with visual or auditory impairments. Each year, there are reported 37.3 million falls among individuals aged 65 and above, with one in four seniors experiencing a fall, but less than half informing their doctor. Falls predominantly occur due to tripping or slipping (67%), rather than from heights. Furthermore, uncomfortable footwear and clothing can contribute to the risk of falls among seniors. Notably, older adults with hearing difficulties have a threefold increased risk of unintentional falls compared to their peers. 

There are several significant problems with the current methods, including: 
There is no uniform detection since there aren't many physiological signal data points that are taken into account when deciding whether to fall.
No fall prediction mechanisms or tactics are incorporated.

The proposed project aims to develop Machine Learning Models utilizing diverse algorithms to detect and predict falls in a timely manner. By leveraging these models, preventive measures can be implemented well in advance to mitigate the risk of falls for individuals. The project focuses on using physiological signals and other relevant data to ensure accurate and consistent fall detection. Additionally, the developed models will incorporate predictive capabilities to anticipate potential falls, enabling proactive interventions. Ultimately, this project seeks to enhance the safety and well-being of elderly individuals by providing an effective and reliable solution for fall detection and prevention.

Physiological Parameters taken under Consideration:
Grasping Pressure
Dietary Habits
Posture
Blood Oxygen Levels
Irregular Heart beats per minute
Surroundings of the User
Location of the User


Using the above listed parameters, Machine Learning Models will be built, with the major consideration on Blood Oxygen Levels. Various ML algorithms will be used for the implementation of the prediction in order to obtain the most precise and accurate output. The algorithms that will be implemented are:
Linear Regression 
Decision Tree classification
Random Forests Classification
K Means Clustering
XGBoost Classification

This project offers crucial support in elderly care, utilizing technological advancements. It aims to assist and provide attention to the needs of the elderly population. By leveraging technology, it can enhance the quality of care and improve safety measures. Overall, this project contributes to ensuring the well-being and support of the elderly
